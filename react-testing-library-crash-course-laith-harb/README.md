    * Test Driven Development
    * write our tests before we write the feature.

* RTL Philosophy
    * Regarless of how things are implemented, the tests should always pass.
    * Test how the software should actually work.
    * Don't test implementation details.
    * Always test how the software is meant to be used, not how its implemented.
