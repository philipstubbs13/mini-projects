* What is Svelte?
  * Compilre for creating reactive web apps and interfaces.
  * Can be used for small parts of a site, or entirely (SPA).
* Other Framework Differences
  * Svelte is a compiler not a framework.
  * Svelte compiles your code for production at build time into a single, vanilla, JavaScript bundle.
  * No extra scripts or libraries are shipped to production.
