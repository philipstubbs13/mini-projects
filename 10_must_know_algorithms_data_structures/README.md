* Linked List
  * like an array on how it's structured, but unlike an array, instead of having indexes and positions, each item in a linked list, points to the next item in the linked list.
* Binary Tree
  * have a root node - one node at the very top.
  * every node in your tree can have at most 2 children.
  * each node has a value and will also have a left and a right, which point to other nodes.
* Stack
  * last in, first out.
  * last item that gets put on to the stack is the first item that gets taken off.
* Queue
  * first in, first out.
  * enqueue
  * dequeue
* Merge Sort
* Dictionary/Map
* Graph
  * Directed graph - points you in the direction you can go from one node to another
  * Undirected graph - there is no direction
  * graphs have vertices/nodes and values.
  * lines have edges - connect one vertice to another vertice.
* Binary Search
* Breadth First Search
* Depth First Search
* Memoization - when you calculate a value and store that value to use later.
  * fibonacci sequence
  * save the output of a calculation so when you have to redo the calculation, you can use the saved output.
* Recursion
  * have a function that calls itself.
* Big O Notation
  * calculate time and space complexity of algorithm
  * you are taking a look at your algorithm and figuring out how many times are you doing an operation. am i doing it n times? am i doing it n squared times? constant time?
