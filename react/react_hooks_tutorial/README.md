  * Ex: State of a component.
  * Hooks don't work inside classes.
* Why Hooks?
  * Understand how this keyword works in JavaScript.
  * Remember to bind event handlers in class components.
  * Classes don't minify very well.
  * There is no particular way to reuse stateful component logic.
  * HOC and render props patters do address this problem.
  * Makes the code harder to follow.
  * There is need to share stateful logic in a better way.
  * Create components for complex scenarios such as data fetching and subscribing to events.
  * Related code is not organized in one place.
