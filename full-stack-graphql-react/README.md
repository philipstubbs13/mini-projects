* What is GraphQL?
    * GraphQL is an open source data query and manipulation language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data.
    * It is an alternative to a REST API, with some added benefits such as the ability to request the exact data that you want.
    * GraphQL servers have a "schema" that specifies all of the fields as well as their "types"
    * The most basic components of a GraphQL schema are object types.
    * express-graphql - a GraphQL server for Node.js with tools to use with Express
