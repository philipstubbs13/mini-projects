* What is PostCSS?
    * A tool for transforming your CSS with JavaScript plugins.
    * Automate CSS tasks.
    * Not the same as a pre-processor like Sass.
    * Used with many popular front-end tooling software.
    * No external compiler needed. Built in as part of your project structure.
* How does it work?
    * Takes your input CSS and converts it into an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) and parses your CSS strings as JS objects.
