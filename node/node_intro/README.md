* Node.js ACTUALLY is...
  * A platform which allows us to run JavaScript on a computer/server/
  * Read, delete, and update files.
  * Easily communicate with a database.
* Why popular?
  * It uses JavaScript.
  * Very fast (runs on the V8 engine and uses non-blocking code)
  * Huge ecosystem of open source packages (npm)
  * Greate for real-time services (like chats)
* JavaScript Engines
  * Computers do not understand JavaScript
  * A JavaScript engine takes JavaScript, and converts it into something it does understand - machine code.
* Node.js is written in C++.
* At the heart of Node.js is the V8 engine.
* The V8 engine converts our JS into machine code.
* Protocols
  * A set of communication rules, that two sides agree to use when communicating.
* Ports
  * A program running on a computer can listen for requests sent to a particular port number.

* Buffer
  * Temporary storage spot for a chunk of data that is being transferred from one place to another.
  * The buffer is filled with data, then passed along.
  * Transfer small chunks of data at a time.
* Streams in Node.js
  * Can create streams in Node.js to transfer data.
  * Increase performance.
* Streams
  * Writeable streams - allow node js to write data to a stream
  * Readable streams - allow node js to read data from a stream
  * Duplex - can read and write to a stream.
