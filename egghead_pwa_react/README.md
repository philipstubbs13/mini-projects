# Progressive Web Apps in React with create-react-app

* Create a PWA that caches static resources used in  our app, which will make it load faster, especially in slow connections.

```bash
create-react-app todo-pwa
cd todo-pwa
yarn start
```

```bash
yarn add express body-parser uuid/v4
```

* Need to turn on service worker in index.js
* Cache first strategy to generate all assets generated by the react app.
* Service worker only registers in production mode.

```bash
serviceWorker.register();
```

* Test service worker by building production version of app

```bash
yarn build
yarn global add serve/ npm i -g serve
serve -s build
```
